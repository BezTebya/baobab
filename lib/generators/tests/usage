Description:
    The test generator creates a set of fixtures and functional and unit 
    tests that are ready to use as the starting point for your
    application. 
    
    The generator takes the name of the model as its first argument. This
    model name is then pluralized to get the controller name. So
    "tests concept" will generate a Concept_test model test and a
    ConceptController functional test.
    
Examples:
    ./script/generate tests concept
