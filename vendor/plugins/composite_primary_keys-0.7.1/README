
Composite Primary Keys for ActiveRecords
Summary:
ActiveRecords/Rails famously doesn't support composite primary keys. 
For 2 years there has been no support for this aspect of legacy databases. 
This project will be a fully-featured solution and I welcome use cases and 
legacy DB schema samples to help make the project work with as many common 
legacy environments as possible.
